Here is an archive of R cheatsheets and presentations I made when I was a postbacc at the University of Michigan. The presentations will download as a .pptx file. 

Most of the cheatsheets are old and were made when I didn't know R as well as I do now, but I still like them. I might try to make updated versions in the future.
