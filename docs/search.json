      "contents": "\nAs an undergraduate at Smith College, I was a member of Dr. Nnamdi\nPole’s lab. I completed my senior thesis on\nfacial expressivity, emotional coherence, and PTSD in a psychotherapy\ncase study.\nAfter graduating, I joined Dr. Christoper Monk’s\nlab as a postbacc lab manager and coordinated study efforts with the\nStudy\nof Adolescent Neural Development (SAND), a substudy of the Fragile Families and Child\nWellbeing Study. I am currently writing a paper on ventral striatum\nconnectivity and reward processing in the SAND sample; we hope to submit\nit to Brain Research soon.\nI joined The Ohio State University’s clinical psychology program in\nFall 2020. I completed my firstyear project on\nautomated facial expression coding in mother-daughter dyads with\nNathaniel Haines.\nBroadly speaking, I am interested in affective science and emotion\nregulation in clinical populations. I am happiest when working with big\ndatasets that need carpentry and visualization. Please contact me via\nemail or Twitter if you\nare interested in collaboration.\n\n\n\n",
