      "contents": "\nAs an undergraduate at Smith College, I was a member of Dr. Nnamdi Pole’s lab. I completed my senior thesis on facial expressivity, emotional coherence, and PTSD in a psychotherapy case study.\nAfter graduating, I joined Dr. Christoper Monk’s lab as a postbacc lab manager and coordinated study efforts with the Study of Adolescent Neural Development (SAND), a substudy of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. I am currently writing a paper on ventral striatum connectivity and reward processing in the SAND sample; we hope to submit it to Brain Research soon.\nI joined The Ohio State University’s clinical psychology program in Fall 2020. I completed my firstyear project on automated facial expression coding in mother-daughter dyads with Nathaniel Haines.\nBroadly speaking, I am interested in affective science and emotion regulation in clinical populations. I am happiest when working with big datasets that need carpentry and visualization. Please contact me via email or Twitter if you are interested in collaboration.\n\n\n\n",
